        <p><em>Historically, red velvet cake was just chocolate cake tinted red from the acid in cocoa powder, not from food coloring.<br> Nowadays most cocoa powders are alkalized, as in stripped of acid. Look for a non-alkalized one for this old-fashioned recipe. <br>Completing the classic look is a coat of bright white ermine frosting, cooked the old-fashioned way.</em></p>
